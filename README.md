# Hello, My name is Javier

I'm a professional Backend software developer for more than 8 years specialised in the development of architectures and APIs..

Since 2014 I have been developing mainly in Java, creating from small applications and backends, to microservices architectures with Spring Cloud and Docker.

Iâ€™m currently working as a ***Java Solution Architect*** in a big company, developing applications for clients and offering advice to different projects to help them to define the best solution in each case.

During these years as a developer I have always liked to experiment with different technologies, regardless of their field of use.
So, although **Java** is my main programming language, I also like to experiment with **Javascript** development and some of its most used frameworks like **Angular** or **Vue** and my last goal is to learn native mobile application development with **Swift** on IOS.


## Github
For years, Github has been as an **Application Blog** where I have been uploading ideas of applications, architectures, utilities and first steps of projects that I wanted to share with my parners and community.

So, this repository should be taken as a testing site and none of the projects is a production version.
